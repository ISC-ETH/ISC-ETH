# ABOUT ISC-ETH

Smart contracts, first proposed by Nick saber in the 1990s, have not been put into practice due to the lack of a credible execution environment.With the advent of blockchain technology, it has been found that blockchain inherently provides a trusted execution environment for smart contracts.Vitalik, the founder of ethereum, was the first to see the combination of blockchain and smart contract and blockchain, and released the world-leading technology of ethereum: next generation smart contract and decentralized application platform. Today's DAPP trend has arrived, and it will inevitably create a new wave of wealth system in the world.

International Smart Contract for Ethereum "ISCE project" is an intelligent Contract based on the underlying development of the Ethereum chain. Isc-eth Contract is the only DAPP technology application developed by many technical teams of Ethereum founders.It is also the world's only contract-based revenue DAPP app.Both income and output are built on the public chain of trusts.It is the only DAPP application based on the ETH common chain.It is also the only revenue platform based on contract system in the world, which solves the trust relationship between investors and the platform, and adopts the tamper-proof electronic contract, which will be the new revolutionary financial market of global block chain.

# Contract Profit Source

The project platform comes from a variety of revenue sources.Futures leveraged contracts participate in the futures trading of ether and receive fixed income.When we invest in community contracts, we can't use them all as nodes because the profit from the nodes is not enough for us to share.For now, most of the money will go to carry trades.For example, when $248 is sold, there will be 10,000 ETH, or $2.48 million;When $218 is retrieved, 2.48 million yuan = 11.3 million ETH, net profit will be 130 ETH.As long as the market goes up or down, there must be margin.Once there is a profit, we will use artificial intelligence to make a trading judgment and place an order. During this period, we will use more leverage chips to enlarge the trading, so you can naturally earn more ETH.We invest in global nodes in supernode award contracts.At the same time, the platform USES the global ethereum for entertainment guessing games, enabling more ethereum nodes to come to life and enabling more people to make money, thus improving the practical application of ethereum.Of course, we can also get ethereum involved in more interactive games in the future, bringing entertainment to all of us. Thanks for joining us!

# Contract revenue

The platform USES the rules of the global order, order acquisition and control model.The platform works by paying a deposit, placing orders for all players and paying the balance, and then paying a deposit seven days later to reward the final round of principal and points.7 percent plus interest on every principal.Successful registration as a star member, can enjoy the generation of direct recommendation income 50%!For example, if you recommend me, I can earn 30 eth per month and you can earn 15eth per month.If you recommend 100 people, the first generation will receive 1500 eth per month.The Eth ride exchange's real-time price is your actual return.Star members need to be replaced, direct promotion needs to be promoted to the standard of 3 effective members and 10 effective members of the umbrella team, enjoying 20% of the second-generation income.After two stars, it is easy to earn 20-60 eth per month.Samsung membership is required.Three of the direct referrals are two-star members, which will cover three-star members.Samsung members receive 10% of third-generation income.Under the condition of four-star standard, four two-star members are directly recommended to reach the standard of four-star members.Four stars enjoy 2% of their fourth-generation income.5 2-star members are directly recommended as 5-star members according to the five-star standard conditions.Five-star members can enjoy 2 percent of their fourth-generation income or an unlimited 2 percent of their income.The final six-star evaluation condition is that I am a five-star member, and one member of my team will be directly promoted to a five-star member and I will reach the six-star level.In addition to enjoying 50% of the first generation, 20% of the second generation, 10% of the third generation, 2% of the fourth generation and 2% of the infinite generation.Also will reward you again 60 eth global dividend, at the same time enjoy the global 1% global smart dividend.
